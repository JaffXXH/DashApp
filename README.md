Deployment Guide
1. Server Deployment with Gunicorn
Create wsgi.py for production deployment:

python
from app import server as application
import os

if __name__ == "__main__":
    port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8050))
    application.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port)
Create requirements.txt:

text
dash>=2.14.0
dash-ag-grid>=1.3.0
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.21.0
plotly>=5.15.0
requests>=2.28.0
gunicorn>=20.1.0
2. Deployment Script (deploy.sh)
bash
#!/bin/bash
# Deployment script for volatility management system

echo "Starting deployment process..."

# Set environment variables
export DASH_ENV=production
export PORT=8050
export VOLATILITY_API_ENDPOINT="http://your-api-endpoint/api"
export DATA_FILE_PATH="/shared/volatility_data.json"

# Create shared directory structure
mkdir -p /shared/volatility_data
chmod 755 /shared/volatility_data

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start application with gunicorn
gunicorn wsgi:application \
    --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT \
    --workers 4 \
    --worker-class sync \
    --timeout 120 \
    --access-logfile - \
    --error-logfile -
3. Shared Drive Deployment
For internal shared drive deployment:

python
# Add to your main app.py
SHARED_DRIVE_PATH = os.getenv('SHARED_DRIVE_PATH', '/mnt/shared_drive/volatility_app')

def setup_shared_drive():
    """Configure shared drive access"""
    try:
        if not os.path.exists(SHARED_DRIVE_PATH):
            os.makedirs(SHARED_DRIVE_PATH, exist_ok=True)
        
        # Create necessary directories
        for subdir in ['data', 'logs', 'config']:
            os.makedirs(os.path.join(SHARED_DRIVE_PATH, subdir), exist_ok=True)
            
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Shared drive setup failed: {e}")
        return False

DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
=======================

A. SERVER-BASED DEPLOYMENT (e.g., Linux/Windows server with Python)

1. Install requirements (best in a virtualenv):
    pip install dash dash-ag-grid plotly pandas numpy requests

2. Place your data file where DATA_FILE_PATH points, or update the path/API accordingly.

3. Start the app:
    python <this_script.py>

4. For production: use WSGI server (e.g., gunicorn or waitress)
    gunicorn <this_script_file_name>:server --bind 0.0.0.0:8050

5. To expose on network: ensure firewall allows port 8050 and use e.g.,
    app.run_server(host="0.0.0.0", port=8050)

B. SHARED DRIVE/INTERNAL NETWORK HOSTING

1. Place the script and optional requirements.txt in a shared folder accessible by your users.

2. Provide a shortcut for users to run:
    python <this_script.py>
   (Requires Python and all dependencies installed for each user.)

3. Alternatively, provide a pre-built executable using PyInstaller.

4. For ease of access, recommend a central server method as in Section A.

C. DOCKERIZED DEPLOYMENT

1. Write a Dockerfile:
    FROM python:3.11-slim
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . /app
    RUN pip install dash dash-ag-grid plotly pandas numpy requests
    CMD ["python", "<this_script.py>"]

2. Build and run container, mapping port 8050.

D. AUTHENTICATION AND SECURITY

- For simple password protection, use dash-auth (HTTP Basic).
- For SSO/enterprise, wrap Dash in Flask with your preferred auth (e.g., flask-login, LDAP; see Plotly Dash docs).
- Serve behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) for SSL and IP-restriction.

E. MONITORING AND LOGGING
- Tail app logs (`python <script> > app.log 2>&1`) or integrate with a centralized log server like ELK.
- For advanced user tracking, use Flask's session and logging.

F. TESTING

- Use pytest or unittest for utility/data functions.
- Dash provides `dash[testing]` and selenium for end-to-end UI tests.

G. UPDATING DATA/APPS

- Update the periodic file or ensure the internal API endpoint returns the latest data.
STEps:
- Review code and adjust API_URL and BACKEND_FILE as needed.
- Install dependencies (Dash, dash-ag-grid, Plotly, pandas, requests, etc.):
pip install dash dash-ag-grid plotly pandas requests
- Start with Gunicorn (from project directory):
gunicorn app:app.server -b 0.0.0.0:8050 --workers 3
- Configure Nginx to listen on port 80 (or 443 for HTTPS) and forward traffic to Gunicorn as per [Nginx+Gunicorn tutorial] and [Gunicorn documentation].
- For Dockerized deployment, define a Dockerfile:
FROM python:3.10
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 8050
CMD ["gunicorn", "app:app.server", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8050", "--workers", "3"]
- For Dash Enterprise, follow the official workflow to deploy apps using the Dash Enterprise CLI.

2. Shared/Internal Network/Shared Drive Deployment
For internal-only deployments (e.g., on a company intranet, dev/test, or via a shared network drive):
- Run Dash server directly on the network host:
python app.py
- Ensure host="0.0.0.0" (as in script) so other computers on the same network can access at http://<host-ip>:8050.
- Use IP address of the server for colleagues to connect via browser.
- Place code and requirements.txt on shared drive. Users can pip install -r requirements.txt and run directly.
- Optionally, use pyinstaller or cx_Freeze to distribute a self-contained executable, and instruct users to open browser to the correct URL.
- No need for Nginx in most internal setups unless SSL/reverse proxy is needed.
Note:
- For Windows shared drives, both .py file and data files must reside on the shared folder.
- Ensure only one user runs the app on the shared port to avoid conflicts
